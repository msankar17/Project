#This Program will help to understand 

# Why intentation is important in python
# Comments start with hashes and they can be used even from middle of the line
# Use semicolon to enter multiple lines of code in single line
# Use \ to enter single line code into mulitple lines
# Mutitple statements together form a code block

a=6
# conditions like if,else, while, def etc will have a first line ending with : and followed by multiple
# intented lines that form a code block
if a==6:
    print("A is 6")
else:
    print("A is not 6") 
    print(a)  # these 2 print statements are executed only in case of A <>6
print("Intentation is extermly important in Python, this is printed regardless of ifelse condition")  

print("This statement is a proof");print("that multiple lines of code can be");print("typed in a single line")

print("This statement is a prrof that single line \
of code can be typed into multiple lines \
for better reading")
